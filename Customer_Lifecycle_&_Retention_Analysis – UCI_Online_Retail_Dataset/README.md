## 🛍 Customer Lifecycle & Retention Analysis – UCI Online Retail Dataset
### 📖 Project Overview

This project analyses customer behaviour and retention patterns using the UCI Online Retail Dataset (transactions from a UK-based e-commerce store). The goal was to understand how customer cohorts behave over time, identify key retention trends, and estimate customer lifetime value (CLV).

The work combines data wrangling, cohort analysis, retention visualisation, and customer segmentation to generate insights that can inform real-world marketing and growth strategies.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

- SQL: for exploratory queries and frequency analysis

- Power BI: for interactive dashboards

- Excel: initial exploration and data cleaning

### 📊 Key Analyses
1. Cohort Analysis

    Customers were grouped by their first purchase month (CohortMonth).
    For each cohort, retention and revenue were tracked across monthly periods (CohortPeriod) to reveal how customer engagement evolved over time.

    Outputs:

      - Customer Retention Heatmap – shows how many customers from each cohort remained active after 1, 2, 3… months.

      - Revenue Retention Heatmap – shows how much of the cohort’s original revenue was retained over time.

    Insight Example:
        Early cohorts showed a sharp revenue drop (around 60–70% loss by month 3), stabilising around 15–30% for mature cohorts — indicating a small group of   loyal customers driving consistent revenue.

2. Purchase Frequency Analysis

     A distribution of the number of purchases per customer highlighted the dominance of one-time buyers, but also revealed a smaller, valuable segment of repeat  and loyal buyers.
     This suggests strong potential for retention campaigns focused on re-engaging first-time customers.

3. Customer Segmentation & Lifecycle Metrics

   Customers were segmented into:

   - New Customers: first-time buyers in the month

    - Repeat Customers: made 2–4 purchases

    - Loyal Customers: made 5+ purchases

   Metrics calculated:

    - 30-, 60-, 90-day retention

    - Average purchase frequency

    - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) approximation

📈 Power BI Dashboard

- The final dashboard (built in Power BI) visualises:

- Cohort retention heatmaps

- Customer lifecycle funnel

- Purchase frequency distribution

- Monthly revenue trends

- Customer segmentation metrics

This interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to explore how acquisition, retention, and revenue interact over time.

## 📚 Data Source

 UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Retail Dataset
 Transactions from a UK-based online retailer between Dec 2010 and Dec 2011.

Note: The raw dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing terms. Only derived and processed files are shared.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Most customers make only one purchase — retention is the main growth lever.

Revenue retention stabilises around 20–30% for mature cohorts, showing a loyal base.

Clear opportunity for targeted engagement and loyalty programs to lift repeat behaviour.

Cohort and lifecycle analyses are practical tools for understanding long-term customer value.
